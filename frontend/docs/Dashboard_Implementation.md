## Bug Fixes Applied

### TypeScript/ESLint Issues Fixed

#### 1. **Unused Variable Warning** in `DashboardPage.tsx`
- **Issue**: `cardBg` variable was assigned but never used
- **Fix**: Removed the unused `cardBg` variable assignment
- **Location**: Line 150 in the stats card rendering loop

#### 2. **Type Error** in `ComprehensiveDashboard.tsx`
- **Issue**: TypeScript error `Property 'user' does not exist on type 'never'`
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent type definitions between Shop and Invoice interfaces
  - Shop interface: `salesman: Salesman` (object with user property)
  - Invoice interface: `salesman: number` (just the ID)
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated Shop filtering to use optional chaining: `shop.salesman?.user?.id === user?.id`
  - Kept Invoice filtering as ID comparison: `inv.salesman === user?.id`
- **Location**: Lines 190-203 in `loadSalesmanDashboard()` method

### Type Safety Improvements
- Simplified complex type casting with proper optional chaining
- Maintained type safety while handling API response variations
- Ensured consistent data filtering across different entity types

### Code Quality Enhancements
- Removed unnecessary type checking and casting
- Improved readability with cleaner filtering logic
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API responses

This implementation provides a production-ready dashboard that aligns with the backend test cases and delivers a comprehensive business management experience for both owners and salesmen in the Aloe Vera Paradise system.
